# Recommendations for Project Improvement

1. **Implement Airflow DAG**
   * Create complete DAGs for batch processing that schedule regular data loads from NOAA
   * Implement table maintenance tasks like compaction and snapshot expiration
   * Add integration with existing components like batch_loader.py and stream_processor.py

2. **Enhance Time Travel Capabilities**
   * Build on existing time travel implementation in Athena and DuckDB
   * Add visualization for comparing data between snapshots
   * Implement a UI for browsing and restoring table versions

3. **Expand Query Engine Support**
   * Add concrete examples for Spark and Flink integration 
   * Create Docker containers for each supported engine for easy testing
   * Implement benchmark comparisons between query engines

4. **Implement Schema Evolution Examples**
   * Demonstrate Iceberg's schema evolution capabilities
   * Show how to add, rename, or reorder columns
   * Include examples of handling schema changes across engines

5. **Implement CDC (Change Data Capture) Support**
   * Add support for tracking data changes
   * Show examples of merge operations with Iceberg
   * Demonstrate how to handle deletes and updates

6. **Add Data Quality Validation**
   * Implement Great Expectations or other data quality framework
   * Add data quality checks in the processing pipeline
   * Create reports of data quality metrics

7. **Enhance Security Features**
   * Add row/column-level security with Iceberg
   * Implement fine-grained access control
   * Add encryption for sensitive data

8. **Create a Dashboard UI**
   * Build a simple dashboard to monitor data processing
   * Add visualization of climate data trends
   * Implement admin panel for job management

9. **Add Terraform Scripts**
   * Create Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
   * Automate AWS infrastructure setup
   * Include environment-specific configurations

10. **Enhance Local Development Environment**
    * Complete the local warehouse setup for offline development
    * Expand the Docker Compose configuration
    * Create a fully functional development environment

11. **Enhance Testing**
    * Add more comprehensive test coverage
    * Implement property-based testing for data transformations
    * Add performance tests for different query engines

12. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**
    * Add GitHub Actions or other CI/CD workflow
    * Automate testing and deployment
    * Include linting and code quality checks

13. **Enhance Error Handling and Monitoring**
    * Implement more robust error handling
    * Add monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
    * Set up alerts for critical failures

14. **Optimize Performance**
    * Add data partitioning optimizations
    * Implement data compaction strategies
    * Add benchmarking tools

15. **Add Project Nessie Integration**
    * Implement Git-like version control for tables with Project Nessie
    * Create configuration for different branches (dev, staging, prod)
    * Add examples of branching and merging strategies
