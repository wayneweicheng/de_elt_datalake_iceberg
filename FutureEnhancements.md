# Recommendations for Project Improvement

1. **Add Airflow DAG Implementation**
   * The project mentions Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow) but lacks actual DAGs
   * Create DAGs for batch processing that schedule regular data loads from NOAA
   * Implement table maintenance tasks like compaction and snapshot expiration

2. **Implement Project Nessie for Version Control**
   * Set up Project Nessie to provide Git-like version control for Iceberg tables
   * Create configuration for different branches (dev, staging, prod)
   * Add examples of time travel queries using Nessie tags/branches

3. **Expand Query Engine Support**
   * Add concrete examples for Spark, Trino, and Flink integration
   * Implement a small sample application using each engine
   * Create Docker containers for each supported engine for easy testing

4. **Add Schema Evolution Examples**
   * Demonstrate Iceberg's schema evolution capabilities
   * Show how to add, rename, or reorder columns
   * Include examples of handling schema changes across engines

5. **Implement CDC (Change Data Capture) Support**
   * Add support for tracking data changes
   * Show examples of merge operations with Iceberg
   * Demonstrate how to handle deletes and updates

6. **Add Data Quality Validation**
   * Implement Great Expectations or other data quality framework
   * Add data quality checks in the processing pipeline
   * Create reports of data quality metrics

7. **Enhance Security Features**
   * Add row/column-level security with Iceberg
   * Implement fine-grained access control
   * Add encryption for sensitive data

8. **Create a Basic Web UI**
   * Build a simple dashboard to monitor data processing
   * Add visualization of climate data trends
   * Implement admin panel for job management

9. **Add Terraform Scripts**
   * Create Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
   * Automate AWS infrastructure setup
   * Include environment-specific configurations

10. **Implement Local Development Environment**
    * Complete the local warehouse setup for offline development
    * Add Docker Compose for required services
    * Create a fully functional development environment

11. **Enhance Testing**
    * Add more comprehensive test coverage
    * Implement property-based testing for data transformations
    * Add performance tests for different query engines

12. **Add Documentation and Examples**
    * Create a comprehensive documentation site with Sphinx
    * Add Jupyter notebooks with examples
    * Include architectural decision records (ADRs)

13. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**
    * Add GitHub Actions or other CI/CD workflow
    * Automate testing and deployment
    * Include linting and code quality checks

14. **Enhance Error Handling and Monitoring**
    * Implement more robust error handling
    * Add monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
    * Set up alerts for critical failures

15. **Optimize Performance**
    * Add data partitioning optimizations
    * Implement data compaction strategies
    * Add benchmarking tools
